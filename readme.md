# Eurorack PCB Helper

This is a KiCad plugin for generating standard Eurorack faceplates and PCBs. For faceplates, specify the module width in HP, corner radius and M3 mounting hole width and whether to include mounting holes for the rear PCB. For PCBs, the mounting hole width need not be specified as it is a standard M3. 

## Installation
Copy the repository into the plugins directory for KiCad, then in PcbNew go to Tools > External Plugins > Refresh Plugins.
